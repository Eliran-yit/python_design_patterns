Objects use other objects' properties/members through inheritance and composition

Composition lets us make compound objects
    E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or
    A grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes

Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar)
and composite objects uniformly
    I.e., Foo and Sequence (yielding Foo's) have common APIs

Composite is a mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions
of objects in a uniform manner
