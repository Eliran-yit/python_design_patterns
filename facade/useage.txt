Balancing complexity and presentation or usability

Typical home
    Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation)
    Complex internal structure (e.g, floor layers)
    End user is not exposed to internals

Same with software:
    Many systems working to provide flexibility, but ...
    API consumers want it to 'just work'

Provides a simple, easy to understand / user interface over a large and sophisticated body to code
