Want to augment an  object with additional functionality

Do not use to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP)

Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP)

Need to be able to interact with existing structures

Two options:
    Inherit from required object (if possible)
    Build a Decorator, which simply references the decorated object(s)



Decorator facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them
