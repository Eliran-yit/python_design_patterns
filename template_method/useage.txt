Algorithms can be decomposed into the common parts + specifics

Strategy pattern does this through composition
    High level algorithm expects strategies to conform to an interface
    Concrete implementations implement the interface

Template Method does the same through inheritance
    Overall algorithm defined in base class; makes use of abstract members
    Inheritors override that abstract members
    Template method invoked to get work done


Allows us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclasses.
