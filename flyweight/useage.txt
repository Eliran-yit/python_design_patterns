Memory Design pattern

Avoid redundancy when storing data

E.G, MMORPG
    plenty of users with identical first/last names
    No sense in storing name first / last name over and over again
    Store a list of names and references to them

EG., bold or italic text formatting
    Don't want each character to have a formatting character
    Operate on ranges (e.g, line number, start/end positions)

A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.
