Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher and lower level parts

Making tea can be decomposed into
    The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup);
    Tea-specific things (put teabag into water)

The high level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate
    supported by beverage specific strategies


Enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected at run-time.
