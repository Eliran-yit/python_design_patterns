We need to be informed when a certain things happen
    Objects property changes
    Object does something
    Some external event occurs

We want to listen to events and be notified when they occur
    Notifications should include useful data

Want to unsubscribe from events if we're no longer interested


An observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system.
The entity generating the events is an observable
