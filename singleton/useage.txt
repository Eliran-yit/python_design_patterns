For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
    Database repository
    Object factory

E.g., the initializer call is expensive
    we only do it once
    We provide everyone with the same instance

Want to prevent anyone to creating additional copies

Need to take care of lazy instantiation


Singleton is a component which is instantiated only once
